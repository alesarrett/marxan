marxan tutorial
============


The marxan R package is designed to bring the entire Marxan work-flow to R. It provides functions for preparing raw data for Marxan, running Marxan, and visualising Marxan results. It is designed to be fast. To achieve this aim, many of the computationally intensive operations are performed in C++ and can easily be completed using parallel processing. However, the package was also designed to be robust and flexible. Marxan users need to be able to change any aspect of a conservation planning scenario and the Marxan parameters. To achieve this, the package makes extensive use of S4 classes, along with S3 and S4 dispatch methods.
